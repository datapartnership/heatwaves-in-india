## Objectives of this project
In recent years, the Government of Kerala has invested significantly in data , recognizing it as a critical resource that will advance policy decisions and effect efficient resource-sharing and building amongst the government, businesses and communities. 

Currently, there are several plaforms that host these open data:
- [Open Government Data Portal of Kerala](https://kerala.data.gov.in/) : intended for use by Departments and Organizations of Government of Kerala to publish datasets, documents, services, tools and applications collected by them for public use. 
- [Map Kerala](https://map.opendatakerala.org/) : an Open Data Kerala initiative that hosts downloadable geospatial information for Kerala districts.
The team built several demos to illustrate use cases with open data that industry practitioners and governments can use as references. 

## Analysing Heatwaves and Air Quality in Kerala
Using Open Data retrieved from public platforms, the team studied the impact of heatwaves and air quality in Kerala, specifically in Kochi (also known as Cochin) and Trivandrum (also known as Thiruvananthapuram). 

Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risk to health, contributing to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and premature death. Heatwaves, on the other hand, impact human health through heat-related illnesses such as heatstroke, dehydration and heat exhaustion. 
In addition to health impacts, air pollution and heatwaves can lead to droughts, wildfires, displacement and migration, having environmental, economic and social impacts as well.
Tracking heatwaves and air pollution levels can help governments and policy makers make informed policies and decisions to improve public and environmental health.

## Who is this for
Data Scientists, Public Health Officials, Emergency Responders, Policy Makers, Urban Planners and Local Government Officials, Environment Scientists and Researchers, General Public

## Future Work 
The work can be expanded to other cities in Kerala, and even in India. 
Predictive Air Pollution levels: Future work can explore different machine-learning models and compare accuracy. It can also incorporate other variables into the data for analysis. 
There is also potential to layer the current analysis with other information, such as meteorological data, socio-economic data and transportation data for other insights.

<!-- ## Challenge

Heatwaves could impact the progress made in at least 10 of the 17 SDGs making them a critical, global phenomenon that needs to be addressed collectively and with urgency. Unlike sudden-onset disasters, heatwaves do not come with the drama of flying roofs and flooded streets. On the contrary, they are silent killers that trigger cascading impacts on agriculture, food security, healthcare, education, employment, energy, water supply, urban resilience, and human development. In 2022 alone, extreme heat has been the leading cause of crop failures in India, hydropower shortages in China, and exacerbated flooding in Pakistan through accelerated melting of glaciers. However, even within the same country, these impacts are not felt by every person and every sector equally. To inform targeted policy interventions that alleviate the impact of extreme heat, it is important to assess the vulnerability of different sectors to extreme heat at a granular scale, using a standardized methodology.

Currently, there is no standardized methodology to define or assess the impacts from heatwaves. Each meteorological department uses their own dataset and definition to estimate heatwaves and often do not differentiate the definition of a heatwave between people and crops. Impact from natural disasters is often measured in terms of number of deaths, number of people impacted, and economic losses caused by it. Such a methodology cannot be applied to heatwaves because it is a slow-onset disaster and the impacts from it are not felt immediately after the event.

## Proposed Solution

The team proposes the use of different definitions of heatwaves applicable to crops and people separately. These definitions will allow for the monitoring of impacts in different sectors differently. The impact can be measured across the sectors of health, electricity, water, agriculture, and the economy using a standard set of indicators (listed below).

One important impact of heatwaves is the triggering of cascading natural disasters – floods and droughts. To account for this, two indicators are identified. These two indicators allow for the spatial mapping of areas that are flood-prone and drought-prone due to heatwaves, thus making them more vulnerable.

The following indicators are proposed to assess the impact of heatwaves across sectors - The following indicators will be calculated at the granularity of the lowest administrative boundary data available, preferably a city. The impact will be measured between the years 2015 and 2022. -->
